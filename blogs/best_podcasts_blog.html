                A medium of information that has increasingly appealed to me over the past several months has been
                podcasts. I believe that this is an underappreciated form of media that could help teenagers and
                young adults to make sense of this confusing world. As you go through this list I have compiled keep
                in mind that these are only my preferences and any questions or comments are always welcome in the

                <div class="pl-lg-5 pl-xs-0">
                    <p>
                        I will preface this list by saying that my favourite Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) episodes have been the
                        ones that changed my opinions on a wide range of issues. These episodes have influenced my outlook on
                        the world and without a doubt shine through at any philosophical or political debate with peers.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Probably my favourite single podcast episode of all time. Significant credit goes to Joe Rogan
                            for a phenomenal interview with one of the most interesting minds of our era. (This is the episode
                            where Elon smokes weed on a livestream).

                        <li>
                            An incredibly insightful JRE episode with perspectives from two incredibly intelligent individuals.
                            They discuss university bias, the holocaust and Hitler, and additional issues that resulted in a
                            very interesting discussion.

                        <li>
                            Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter brought along Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde to answer questions
                            from journalist Tim Pool about the company. First, huge respects to Jack for agreeing to
                            participate in this interview. This episode showed the world the (often untold) perspective
                            of social media companies in post-2016 America. This episode will undeniably change your
                            perspective on the role of social media in society.

                        <li>
                            An incredible interview with a former member of the controversial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westboro_Baptist_Church">Westboro Baptist Church</a>.
                            Megan has a perspective that few people poses after her bizarre interactions with the

                        <li>
                            Wow. Certainly the most motivational podcast I have ever listened to. <a href="https://davidgoggins.com/">Goggins</a> is a retired navy
                            seal, an ultramarathon runner and amongst other skills an incredible motivational speaker. A
                            fascinating story that just gets crazier and crazier as Goggins explains his life and his route to
                            personal success.

                        <li>
                            A very insightful history lesson from Uncle Snowden about how American intelligence changed post
                            9-11. It is great to hear the story from his perspective and not from a government institution
                            nor internet conspiracy theorists.

                        <li>
                            I am generally not that attracted to comedians on Joe’s show but since I already knew
                            Schultz from his comedies I decided to give him a listen. I ended up learning more about Joe
                            Rogan on this podcast than I expected. Schultz is a very smart guy with interesting takes on
                            issues. Many of his videos regarding political issues recently went viral on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andrewschulz/?hl=en">Instagram</a> and

                    <p>
                        A fantastic podcast by former navy seal lieutenant commander Jocko Willink. Jocko popularized the
                        phrase “Discipline equals Freedom” with an addictive podcast format that makes every new episode
                        interesting and exciting. He frequently interviews people with fascinating life stories that
                        have gone through insane paths to get to where they are today.

                        <li>
                            My favourite episode of Jocko’s podcast. Jonny is a former navy seal, a doctor from
                            Harvard medical school, and most recently a Nasa astronaut. Too many people in society do
                            not even dream of achieving even one of these accomplishments yet Kim, with fantastic
                            storytelling, explains what it took for him to excel at everything he does. This epic 5-hour
                            podcast is sure to inspire any and all listeners.

                <div class="pl-5">
                    <p>
                        Arguably the best history podcast available on the internet. I have spent over 100 hours on many episodes
                        learning what high school history class could only dream of teaching me. Dan Carlin made
                        learning history fun and incredibly interesting. Regardless how controversial and divisive the
                        event, Carlin can always take an objective view of the subject at hand.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            An epic six-episode trek into the first world war. I would truly recommend this to anyone
                            regardless of their interest in the era. Far too many people say, “World War 2 is more
                            interesting that World War 1,” but the way Dan Carlin explains this conflict will undoubtedly
                            change their perspective.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This four-part series is focused on the Western front of the second world war between the
                            Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. A highly informative series that somehow manages to put in
                            perspective the atrocities committed by both sides in this part of the war.

                            however to start with Blueprint for Armageddon and Ghosts of the Ostfront.

                            get immersed in this chaotic and convoluted world that is in too many ways similar to the

                            While this may not seem like an interesting subject to most, we have all at some point

                            legal penalties for tax evasion. These episodes will instantly spark interest in a world
                            few people know exists. This was the first podcast I listened to after online
                            recommendations (mostly reddit) and it is a no brainer for anyone interested in exploring
                            this medium.

                            An eye-opening episode about second order consequences of a seemingly effective method of
                            policing. Especially relevant now with increased public pressure on municipalities to cut
                            police budgets.

                            This episode follows a stolen snapchat account through the darkest parts of the web and
                            along the way discovers many flaws with the ways we depend on our online accounts. After
                            listening to this episode, I began using a password manager and 2-factor authentication
                            for all my internet accounts.

                        I must show some support for my boys Jaron and Gavin from Winnipeg. It is always great to hear

                        Give these guys <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/t-a-a-a-a-a-podcast/id1476609686">a listen</a> and you will not regret it!

                            An incredibly informative and interesting investigative series of episodes that uncovers the
                            life of Guantanamo bay detainee 244, Abdul Latif Nasser. Amazing storytelling by the
                            Radiolab team which changed my views of certain post 9-11 American policies. Recommended
                            for anyone interested in learning a new perspective on the American war on terror.

                        A fascinating aviation podcast that investigates commercial airline incidents. I would say to
                        avoid this podcast while flying but without a doubt listen to it on the ground. This is a relatively
                        new podcast with only a number of episodes, and while some airline incidents are more interesting
                        than others, I would suggest to begin with
